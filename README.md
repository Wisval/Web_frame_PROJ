Idea has been set though the exploration of the farme is still in progress, though the usage of the framework and how to use it is 
possible, the difficulty of judging which elements in the framework can be cannibalized to use for the idea of an interactive web
app journal, such as the folder that contains files and templates on how to implement icons(depending on wether or not their will be icons in the journal), how the files call and import other .vue(.js) files into another .vue file 
(eg. import WelcomeItem from './WelcomeItem.vue'), the css style of font/color theme etc.
